		<h1>The Terrestrial Planets of the Solar System</h1>
  
		<p>
		  The four inner planets of the Solar System consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are known as terrestrial due to their hard, rocky surface. Compared to the gaseous planets of the outer solar system, the inner terrestrial planets are significantly smaller in size. Depending on tectonic activity and presence of liquids these planets will have features such as canyons, mountains, and volcanoes on their surface.
